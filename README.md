# MoPeDT - **Mo**dular **Pe**ripheral **D**isplay **T**oolkit

We introduce MoPeDT: Modular Peripheral Display Toolkit, a freely available, flexible,
reconfigurable, and extendable headset to conduct peripheral vision research. MoPeDT can be built with a 3D printer and off-the-shelf
components. It features multiple spatially configurable near-eye display modules and full 3D tracking inside and outside the lab.
With our system, researchers and designers can easily develop and prototype novel peripheral vision interaction and visualization
techniques
